# Quizzical Trivia App

This is my final solo project from Scrimba's React Tutorial Course. 
I pulled trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com) and 
used a combination of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and React to construct 
a interface allowing players to interact with the pulled questions. 

## Basic Features 

The core functionality of the trivia app lies in two features:

- Pulling questions from the trivia database api 
- Users can select, submit, and receive feedback on their choices

## Additional Features

Some additional features I added to the trivia app are:

- Creating an initial form that allows users to select game options
- Users can select the number of questions
- Users can to select what type of questions (T/F or multiple choice)
- Users can to select the difficulty of questions 
- After completing one round, users can choose to either play on the current settings or change the existing settings

## Purpose and What I Learned

The main reason for doing this project is as an illustration of what I've learned
by completing Scrimba's React Tutorial Course. Before this course, I had no experience
with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, or React. I definitely felt like I learned a lot and 
this project is a culmination of my first couple steps into Frontend Development. 

Some of the core React concepts I used in this project were:

- the useState() hook to store and update variables regarding form data and question choices 
- the useEffect() hook and async functions to receive data from the trivia database 
- Conditional Rendering to be able to switch pages and button coloring on user input
- Forms to receive user input regarding quiz settings
